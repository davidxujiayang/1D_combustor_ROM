1. Bugs in Gauss-Newton subroutine fixed.

2. You can choose between Van Leer and Roe flux (slow) scheme for the Jacobian of 
   residual in Gauss-Newton method. (The residual itself is from Roe scheme).

3. You don't have to re-run steady state solver and FOM solver. 
   However the Jacobian has to be re-generated.
